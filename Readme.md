I am currently Professor and [Canada Research Chair in Political Methodology](http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca) in the department of [Political Science](http://www.politicalscience.uwo.ca) at Western University in London, Ontario. I teach courses on political methodology and Comparative Politics. Find out more about the courses I [teach](/teach).

Much of my substantive research focuses on the link between state repression and democratic institutions/behavior. Methodologically, my interests have taken me in a number of different  directions on collaborative projects, though the measurement and scaling seem to be common themes. Visit my [research page](/research) or download my full [CV](/files/documents/armstrongcv.pdf).

I've also had the privilege of teaching at the ICPSR Summer Program since 2006. I really value the experiences I had as a participant (2001--03) and a teaching assistant (2002--06) at the Summer Program and consider myself lucky to be a member of the Program's faculty. Please check out the materials for my [ICPSR courses](/teachicpsr).

If you are looking for something that appears to be gone, please just shoot me an [e-mail](mailto:davearmstrong.ps@gmail.com) and I will be happy to forward along what you're looking for.
