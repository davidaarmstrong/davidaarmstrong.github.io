Over my career, I have mostly taught courses on political methodology, though I do offer the occasional comparative politics class as well.  Below, you can find information on the current courses I teach. 

## Western University 

### [POLSCI 9590 - Introduction to Methodology](uwo9590.html)

When I first arrived at Western, this was the only quantitative methods course on the books. I taught this as a primer for how to read quantitative papers and do some rudimentary analyses.  Over time, we expanded the sequence to two and now three courses.  Currently, this course covers introductory statistics ending with simple linear regression.  We spend a lot of time learning R to accomplish these tasks.  <br>[[Syllabus](/files/documents/9590_syllabus_2024.pdf)][[course page](uwo9590.html)]

### [POLSCI 9592 - Maximum Likelihood Estimation](uwo9592.html)

This is a pretty standard third course in methodology that covers GLMs (logits/probits and variants) as well as models for count data. We also consider hierarchical models, multiple imputation/missing data and basic scaling analysis. <br>[[Syllabus](/files/documents/9592_syllabus_2025.pdf)]

### POLSCI 9596 - Applied Bayesian Modeling

This course provides a transition for students who want to investigate Bayesian analysis who until this point have taken courses in Frequentist inference.  The course starts simply with an understanding of priors, likelihoods and posteriors.  We consider cross-sectional models, multilevel models and measurement models. <br> [[Syllabus](/files/documents/9596_syllabus_2023.pdf)]

### POLSCI 959X - Applied Machine Learning

This course was taught as a one-off because of some curricular changes we were making.  The course was mostly centered around supervised learning with a focus on inferential tools for non-linear analysis. <br> [[Syllabus](/files/documents/9592_syllabus_2020.pdf)]

### POLSCI 9598 - Current Research on Conflict and Human Rights

This course is meant to discuss the cutting-edge research in conflict and human rights.  We covered Civil War, State Repression/Human Rights, Terrorism, Non-violent and Violent Protest, Transitional Justice and Peace. To build the syllabus, I combed through 2019-2023 issues of _Journal of Peace Research_, _Journal of Conflict Resolution_, _Conflict Management and Peace Science_, _International Organization_, _International Studies Quarterly_, _Journal of Politics_, _American Journal of Political Science_, _American Political Science Review_ and the _Annual Review of Political Science_ to find articles that fit these themes.  <br>[[Syllabus](/files/documents/9598_syllabus_2024.pdf)]

## ICPSR Summer Program 

### Advanced Regression (aka Regression III)

I have taught the Advanced Regression (previously Regression III) course since 2007 when I took it over from Bob Andersen.  Since then, the course has evolved to a discussion of semi- and non-parametric models and how they're useful in the social sciences.  More recently, the course has reoriented around the idea or robustness and particularly how we can use flexible regression models to test modeling assumptions.<br> [[Syllabus](/files/documents/reg3_syllabus_2024.pdf)]

### R - Learning by Example

This course is an intensive one-week course that hopes to get participants over some of the main stumbling blocks that plague people switching from other software (SPSS, Stata or Sas) to R.  We discuss data wrangling and manipulation, regression models of many different kinds and measurement models.  We talk a bit about programming functions in R as well.  

## Instats

I have taught a few courses for [instats](https://instats.org).  They have an interesting model where synchronous online courses are taught and often that material is transformed to asynchronous on-demand courses.  I've taught the following courses: 
- [Interactive Data Visualization and Dashboards with R](https://instats.org/seminar/interactive-data-visualization-and-dashb0420)
- [Interactive Dashboards and Web Apps with Shiny in R](https://instats.org/seminar/interactive-dashboards-and-web-apps-with3)
- [Interactions and Non-Linearities in Regression Models (R and Stata)](https://instats.org/seminar/interactions-and-non-linearities-in-regr3)
- [Generalized Linear Models for the Social and Health Sciences](https://instats.org/seminar/generalized-linear-models-for-social-and3)
