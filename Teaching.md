Over my career, I have mostly taught courses on political methodology, though I do offer the occasional comparative politics class as well.  Below, you can find information on the courses I've taught at various places. 

## Western University 

### POLSCI 9590 - Introduction to Methodology

When I first arrived at Western, this was the only quantitative methods course on the books. I taught this as a primer for how to read quantitative papers and do some rudimentary analyses.  Over time, we expanded the sequence to two and now three courses.  Currently, this course covers introductory statistics ending with simple linear regression.  We spend a lot of time learning R to accomplish these tasks. 

### POLSCI 9592 - Maximum Likelihood Estimation

This is a pretty standard third course in methodology that covers GLMs (logits/probits and variants) as well as models for count data. We also consider hierarchical models, multiple imputation/missing data and basic scaling analysis. 

### POLSCI 9596 - Applied Bayesian Modeling

This course provides a transition for students who want to investigate Bayesian analysis who until this point have taken courses in Frequentist inference.  The course starts simply with an understanding of priors, likelihoods and posteriors.  We consider cross-sectional models, multilevel models and measurement models. 

### POLSCI 959X - Applied Machine Learning

This course was taught as a one-off because of some curricular changes we were making.  The course was mostly centered around supervised learning with a focus on inferential tools for non-linear analysis.  

## ICPSR Summer Program 

### Advanced Regression (aka Regression III)

I have taught the Advanced Regression (previously Regression III) course since 2007 when I took it over from Bob Andersen.  Since then, the course has evolved to a discussion of semi- and non-parametric models and how they're useful in the social sciences.  More recently, the course has reoriented around the idea or robustness and particularly how we can use flexible regression models to test modeling assumptions. 

### R - Learning by Example

This course is an intensive one-week course that hopes to get participants over some of the main stumbling blocks that plague people switching from other software (SPSS, Stata or Sas) to R.  We discuss data wrangling and manipulation, regression models of many different kinds and measurement models.  We talk a bit about programming functions in R as well.  

### Interactive Data Visualization

I taught the intereactive data viz short course for a couple of years.  The course was a mix of client-side interactivity with dashboards that didn't require shiny and also server-side interactivity that required a shiny server to implement the dashboard.  We worked thorugh several examples that highlighted the important features and decisions in building and deploying web-based apps. 

### Scaling and Dimensional Analysis

In 2001, I took the Scaling and Dimensional class at the ICPSR Summer Program after my second year in graduate school.  It would turn out to be my favourite class of all the classes I have taken at any level of education.  The way that Bill (Jacoby) talked about data and thought about measurement was compelling to me and stirred a deep interest in the subject that remains to this day.  I was Bill's TA from 2002-2006 and was honoured when he asked me to co-teach the course with him in 2011 and 2013.  The course covered topics including summated rating and Mokken scaling, Alternating Least-Squares Optimal Scaling (ALSOS), Exploratory Factor Analysis and Multidimensional Scaling.

## Instats

I have taught a few courses for [instats](https://instats.org).  They have an interesting model where synchronous online courses are taught and often that material is transformed to asynchronous on-demand courses.  I've taught the following courses: 
- [Interactive Data Visualization and Dashboards with R](https://instats.org/seminar/interactive-data-visualization-and-dashb0420)
- [Interactive Dashboards and Web Apps with Shiny in R](https://instats.org/seminar/interactive-dashboards-and-web-apps-with3)
- [Interactions and Non-Linearities in Regression Models (R and Stata)](https://instats.org/seminar/interactions-and-non-linearities-in-regr3)
- [Generalized Linear Models for the Social and Health Sciences](https://instats.org/seminar/generalized-linear-models-for-social-and3)
