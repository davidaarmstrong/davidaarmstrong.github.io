I am currently Professor and [Canada Research Chair in Political Methodology](http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca) in the department of [Political Science](http://www.politicalscience.uwo.ca) at Western University in London, Ontario. I teach courses on political methodology and Comparative Politics.

Much of my substantive research focuses on the link between state repression and democratic institutions/behavior. Methodologically, my interests have taken me in a number of different  directions on collaborative projects, though the measurement and scaling seem to be common themes. Visit my [research page](Research.html) or download my full [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9a2o77xtk50vddtovsago/armstrongcv.pdf?rlkey=k8vx2u2ryh4ddj8te3x6qivfj&dl=0).

I've also had the privilege of teaching at the ICPSR Summer Program since 2006. I really value the experiences I had as a participant (2001--03) and a teaching assistant (2002--06) at the Summer Program and consider myself lucky to be a member of the Program's faculty. I have also taught a couple of courses at the Essex Summer School in Social Science Data Analysis and at the Oxford Spring School.  Recently, I taught a few courses for [instats](https://instats.org) that are available on demand: 
- [Interactive Data Visualization and Dashboards with R](https://instats.org/seminar/interactive-data-visualization-and-dashb0420)
- [Interactive Dashboards and Web Apps with Shiny in R](https://instats.org/seminar/interactive-dashboards-and-web-apps-with3)
- [Interactions and Non-Linearities in Regression Models (R and Stata)](https://instats.org/seminar/interactions-and-non-linearities-in-regr3)
- [Generalized Linear Models for the Social and Health Sciences](https://instats.org/seminar/generalized-linear-models-for-social-and3)
