These slides are for the Interactive Visualization, Dashboards and Apps with R course offered through the ICPSR Summer Program (May 27-29, 2020).  Since the slides are all in HTML, I am hosting them here for lack of a better place, though I may eventually move them to my main site: [quantoid](https://quantoid.net/teachicpsr/shiny).  For now, you can follow the links below to the different slide decks.  

The decks below do not match up especially nicely with the natural breaks in the workshop (i.e., lunch times, end of the day).  At least, I don't think they do.  

[Intro and Preparing for Course](intro/intro.html)
- These slides just identify what kinds of things you need to know for the first day. We'll walk through most of the stuff on the first morning, too.  

[Slide Deck 1](deck1/deck1.html)
- These slides work through interactivity with `plot_ly` and some other HTML widgets.  We're not talking about shiny here, yet, but these building blocks can be used later on in more complicated shiny apps.  You can get just the plots and code [here](deck1/sharing1.html).  Click [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3daq7ccp62hmyk2/deck1.zip?dl=0) to get the data and code.  

[Slide Deck 2](deck2/deck2.html)
- In these slides, we start to build interactive dashboards, though ones that are pure html (i.e., no R server required), so they can be hosted on any webserver that allows you to upload files (e.g., [github.io](https://github.io), [netlify](https://netlify.com))).    You can get just the plots and code [here](deck2/sharing2.html).  Click [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kskuy9lackb2io0/deck2.zip?dl=0) to get the data and code. 

[Slide Deck 3]() 
- In these slides, we move to talking about shiny and building shiny-based dashboards. 

[Slide Deck 4]()
- In these slides, we extend build on the knowledge from the previous deck and focus on styling apps, building interactive walks through (or is it walk throughs), debugging apps and deploying your shiny creations.
